# Meow and Furrever
### *Because cats deserve care.*
## Project Overview
**Meow and Furrever** is a project dedicated to promoting **responsible cat ownership** and raising awareness about feline health.  
Cats are often seen as low-maintenance or “self-sufficient,” leading many owners to skip vet visits or neglect preventative care.  
Our mission is to change that perception by showing that cats are not just small dogs — they are a **separate species** with unique behaviors, health needs, and ways of communicating.
This project includes an app concept where users can create profiles for their cats, receive personalized care reminders, learn about feline behavior, and **debunk common myths** about catc ownership.
## Objectives
- Educate cat owners about the importance of preventative care and regular vet visits.
- Disprove the myths that cats don't need attention, checkups, or training.
- Highlight that cats have their own species-specific needs - physical, emotional, and behavioral.
- Encourage responsible, lifelong care and adoption.
